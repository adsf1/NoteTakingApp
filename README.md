#### Notes:

- Since AWS Elastic IPs for EC2 instances are paid, it will be
needed to change the Jenkins IP on Github repository webhook manually
everytime the EC2 instance is run and gets a new IP.

#### TODO:

- Continue configuring pipeline in Jenkins and complete Jenkinsfile
  https://community.jenkins.io/t/jenkins-not-able-to-connect-to-git-repository/8707/8
- Jenkins could send email when build fails and set status on Github after build
